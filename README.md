# Description

My friend and I were trying to find a way to play a game in which we could draw a word and try to make others guess the word by drawing or mimicking it but we didn't have cards with words on them to play with. So I came up with the idea of building this application in which you can draw words and play with them.

# How to use the application

1. Press button to draw a new word.

# Author comments

I hope people enjoy using this application to easily draw words and play games with them. Have fun!

# How to run the project locally

Run with the extension "Live server".

If there are changes to the main.ts file, run the command: 
> tsc 

to transpile the Typescript to Javascript (the transpiled code will be in the build folder).

Because we are using "Live server" extension, the page will automatically reload in the browser and it will be already reading the new build/main.js generated.
